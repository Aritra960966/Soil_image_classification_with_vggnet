# 🌱 Soil Classification using VGGNet, MLflow, and Streamlit

A deep learning-based application for classifying soil types using image data. This project leverages **VGGNet** for image classification, **MLflow** for tracking experiments, and **Streamlit** for interactive web deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Image Classification**: Predict soil types (e.g., clay, sandy, loamy, etc.) from images using a custom-trained VGGNet model.
- 📊 **MLflow Integration**: Log hyperparameters, metrics, model artifacts, and training runs.
- 🖼️ **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly web app for image upload and real-time predictions.
- 💾 **Model Versioning**: Track, compare, and load different model versions with MLflow.
